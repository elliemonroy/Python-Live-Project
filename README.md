# Python Live Project

## Introduction
During my time at The Tech Academy, I had the opportunity to work alongside a team of software developers on a web application called the App Builder 9000. The App Builder 9000 is an interactive website for managing one's collections of things related to various hobbies, as well as API and Data Scraped content for those hobbies. The goal of the project was to create an application with a topic of our own choice within the App Builder 9000 working with the Django Framework. When building the app we needed to create databases to keep track of data, CRUD functionality and have the app interact with an API to retrieve data and use Beautiful Soup to scrape data. The work environment we worked under was Azure Devops following the Agile methodologies, and we were all assigned to finish a set of stories before the end of the sprint that lasted two weeks.

The Application I decided to create was Doggy Daycare. The main purpose of my application is to allow the user to make a reservation for their dog. It also allows the user to make modifications and lets them look at the details of their reservation.

 ## Display All Items From The Database And Details Page
 All the dog reservations show up on the reservation page and when you click on details it takes you to the details page.

## Skills Acquired 
 - Gained more hands-on experience with working with Python and the Django Framework.
 - Working with a group of developers effectively to finish a project within a certain time frame.
 - Daily stand-ups and weekly code retrospectives.
 - This experience has taught me a lot of valuable information that I will definitely take with me moving forward in my coding journey.
